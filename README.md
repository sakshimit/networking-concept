Protocols:
a protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is transmitted and received between devices in a network.

1.TCP(transmission control protocol)
connection oriented
non real time data transfer
re-transmit of data is possible
acknowledgement feature

2.UDP(USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL)
Connectionless 
real time application
no retransmit data
ex. video streaming , online gaming


IP(INTERNET PROTOCOL)
manages the addressing and routing for data packets across network

PORTS:
ports are communication endpoint that allow different services on a device to send and recieve data.

port 22 :ssh
port 53: DNS
port 80: HTTP



SUBNETTING(CIDR):
TO divide a larger ip netwrork into smaller more manageable sub-netwroks or subnets


ROUTING:
routing is the process of directing data packets from source to a destination across a netwrok.

DNS:
translates easy to remember domain names to computer friendly Ip addresses


VPN:
virtual private network ,is like a secure tunnel for  your internet connection
